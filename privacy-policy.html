            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3>Personal Information</h3>
            <p>We collect personal information that you provide directly when you register, use the Services, or communicate with us, including contact information such as name and email address, account credentials such as username and password, payment information such as payment method details when required, profile information such as company name or job title if provided, and communication preferences.</p>

            <h3>Automation Data</h3>
            <p>When you use our Services, we collect information about Flows you execute, data processed through our automation platform, website credentials you choose to store which are encrypted, performance metrics of your automations, natural language prompts and commands you provide, and websites you automate and interact with through SuperEffective.</p>

            <h3>Usage Information</h3>
            <p>We automatically collect information about your interactions with our Services, including log data such as IP address, browser type, pages visited, and time spent, device information such as device type, operating system, and browser version, location information derived from IP address, usage patterns and preferences, and Flow execution history, success rates, and error logs.</p>

            <h3>Screen Recordings and Browser Activity</h3>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p>During Flow execution, we record your screen and capture visual content displayed in your browser. This includes website content you access during automation, personal information visible on screen during Flow execution, data from all browser tabs and windows visible during execution, notifications, pop-ups, and other visual elements present during automation, and any other visual information displayed in your browser during Flow execution.</p>
            </div>

            <p>These screen recordings may capture sensitive information that happens to be visible in your browser, including personal messages, financial information, private documents, or confidential business information.</p>

            <h3>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
            <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track activity on our Services. Cookies are files with a small amount of data that may include an anonymous unique identifier. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.</p>

            <h3>Beta Period Data Collection</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p>During the beta testing period, we have significantly broader access to your data than described above. Specifically, during beta we may access and review all Flow executions in unencrypted, plain-text form, natural language prompts and commands in full detail, all websites you automate and data you extract or download, stored credentials in decrypted form during execution monitoring, complete screen recordings capturing all visual content in your browser, all data transmitted to or from third-party websites during Flow execution, error logs, debugging information, and detailed execution traces, and any other information generated or processed during your use of the Services.</p>
            </div>

            <p>This comprehensive monitoring is necessary for debugging, platform development, quality assurance, security monitoring, and service improvement during the beta period.</p>

            <p>This level of access is broader than will be maintained after the beta period ends. Upon transition to general availability, we will implement stricter data access controls and limitations.</p>
