        <section class="section">
            <h2>Our Services</h2>

            <h3>Description of SuperEffective</h3>
            <p>SuperEffective ("the Service") is an automated invoice retrieval platform that connects to your software-as-a-service (SaaS) accounts, business email and supplier websites to collect, download, and centralize invoices on your behalf.</p>

            <p>Users upload a CSV file (or a plain text) listing the invoices they need to retrieve.</p>

            <p>Then SuperEffective uses one of those 2 methods to retrieve invoices. This default choice is based on successes observed by other user but can be override by the user:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Search through user emails:</strong> using search function, SuperEffective will try to identify an email containing the invoice, open it and download the invoice. SuperEffective might open all emails that seems relevant to the AI</li>
                <li><strong>Log into vendors platforms:</strong> SuperEffective automatically authenticates to the specified vendor platforms using secure OAuth/SSO protocols, locates the corresponding invoices, downloads them</li>
            </ol>

            <p>SuperEffective delivers them to the user's preferred destinations (using the user's mail box or finance platform integration).</p>

            <p>The Service acts as an automated agent that performs invoice collection tasks that would otherwise require manual login and download from each individual vendor platform.</p>

            <p>All execution happens directly in Your browser, which provides several critical advantages. We never store Your website credentials on our servers and you are not meant to share it with us in a prompt. The automation naturally bypasses anti-bot systems since traffic originates from Your real browser session. You maintain full control over what the automation can access at all times.</p>

            <p>SuperEffective is only focused on invoice retrieval, representing a simple and universal pain point that classic automation platforms do not address out of the box. Do not try to use for anything else.</p>

            <h3>Early Stage Warnings and Limitations</h3>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p>Agent-executed tasks have uncertain success rates and may fail, execute incorrectly, or produce unexpected results. Please review retrieved invoices with the review mode on the website. You must actively supervise the agent during execution. Do not run automations in the background unattended during this beta period. We strongly recommend starting with non-critical, low-risk tasks to understand how the platform works before progressing to more sensitive use cases.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Browser Access and Single Sign-On (SSO) Risks</h3>
            <p>When You grant SuperEffective access to Your browser and authorize it to perform actions on a website, You are providing access that extends far beyond that single website. Because SuperEffective operates with full control over Your browser session, including control over the Single Sign-On function, the platform may automatically gain access to all services and accounts listed in the prompt via the primary accounts You have authorized.</p>

            <h3>Critical Understanding of Browser Control</h3>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p>When an automation is running in Your browser, SuperEffective acts in Your name and on Your behalf. All actions performed by Flows appear to third-party websites as if You personally performed them. Websites cannot distinguish between actions You take manually and actions SuperEffective takes automatically. This means that any Flow execution is legally and practically attributed to You as the account holder, regardless of whether You initiated the specific action or whether it was executed automatically by Our platform.</p>
            </div>

            <p>During Flow execution, SuperEffective records Your screen, capturing all visual content displayed in Your browser, including but not limited to website content You access, personal information visible on screen, data from all browser tabs and windows, notifications and pop-ups that appear, and any other visual elements present during execution. These screen recordings are stored by Us and may be reviewed by Our team for debugging, security monitoring, and platform improvement purposes, particularly during the beta period.</p>

            <p>You acknowledge and consent that screen recordings may capture sensitive information that happens to be visible in Your browser during Flow execution, including personal messages or emails, financial information or account balances, private documents or files, confidential business information, or any other data visible on screen. We recommend closing or minimizing sensitive content before running automations, or using dedicated browser profiles for SuperEffective.</p>

            <p>This is a critical security consideration that You must understand before using SuperEffective. For example, if You ask SuperEffective to download invoices from Gmail and You are logged into Your Google account, the agent may automatically gain access through SSO to Google Drive, Google Calendar, Google Analytics, YouTube, Google Cloud Platform, and any other Google services linked to that account. The agent does not need to request separate authorization for these connected services because Your browser session already contains the necessary authentication tokens and cookies that enable SSO.</p>

            <p>This SSO behavior means that the agent could unintentionally access more services than You explicitly intended to authorize. Actions could be performed across multiple connected platforms without Your explicit awareness. Data from connected services could be accessed, read, modified, or deleted as part of Flow execution. You may not realize which services are being accessed or affected until after execution has completed or failed.</p>

            <p>The same SSO risk applies to any identity provider or account system that uses Single Sign-On. If You authorize SuperEffective on a Microsoft account, it may access Office 365, Azure, Teams, and all Microsoft services. If You authorize it on an Okta-authenticated service, it may access all services connected through Okta. If You use social login through Facebook or LinkedIn, SuperEffective may access any service where You have used that social login.</p>

            <p>We strongly recommend that during this early beta period, You always watch the agent execute tasks in real-time, do not run automations in the background unattended, start with non-critical and low-risk tasks to understand platform behavior, test new tasks on sandbox or test accounts before using production accounts, and immediately stop execution if the agent accesses unexpected services or data.</p>

            <p>We will update this section as the platform matures and as we implement additional safeguards to manage SSO access more granularly.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Creating an Account</h2>
            <p>To access SuperEffective, You must create an Account on Our website at supereffective.ai. To do so, You must provide accurate and complete information to register to use Our Services. If You create an Account or use the Services on behalf of another person or entity, You must have the authority to accept this Agreement on their behalf. To create Your Account, You must be at least 18 years old or the minimum age required in Your country to be considered as an adult person.</p>

            <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your Account credentials, including Your password, and for all activities that occur under Your Account, whether authorized by You or not. You must notify Us immediately at <a href="mailto:contact@conception.dev">contact@conception.dev</a> of any unauthorized access to Your Account or any other security breach. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from Your failure to maintain Account security. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate Your Account immediately if We detect suspicious or unauthorized activity, if Your Account is used in violation of these Terms, if Your Account poses a security risk to Us or other users or third parties, or if You fail to maintain adequate Account security measures.</p>

            <h3>Account Security Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>You are solely responsible for the security of Your Account and must take all reasonable measures to protect it. You must create a strong and unique password for Your Account and never share Your password with others or use the same password across multiple services. You should use a password manager if You are storing multiple credentials within SuperEffective. You must change Your password immediately if You suspect it has been compromised.</p>

            <p>You must restrict access to Your Account to authorized personnel only if using SuperEffective for business purposes. You must log out of Your Account when using shared or public computers. You should enable two-factor authentication when such functionality becomes available in SuperEffective. You must monitor Your Account activity regularly for any suspicious behavior or unauthorized Flow executions.</p>

            <p>Regarding credential storage within SuperEffective, You must understand that while website credentials stored in the Services are encrypted, no system is completely risk-free. You should only store credentials for websites where You have explicit authorization to automate access. You must regularly review and remove stored credentials You no longer need. You should carefully consider the risks before storing credentials for high-value or sensitive accounts such as banking, primary email, or administrative accounts.</p>

            <p>You must notify Us immediately at <a href="mailto:contact@conception.dev">contact@conception.dev</a> if You detect any unauthorized access to Your Account, if Your password or any stored credentials have been compromised, if You notice suspicious Flow executions that You did not authorize, or if You receive security alerts or warnings related to Your Account.</p>

            <h2>High-Risk Use Cases and Financial Services Warning</h2>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>We strongly discourage using SuperEffective to automate interactions with financial services, banking platforms, investment accounts, brokerage services, payment systems, or cryptocurrency exchanges where Flow failures could result in significant financial harm.</strong></p>
